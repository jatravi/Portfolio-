          <h1>Hey, I'm Ravi Choudhary</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate developer with over 2 years of experience in
            building full-stack applications. I specialize in crafting
            responsive web and mobile interfaces that deliver seamless user
            experiences. Whether it's the frontend finesse or backend logic â€” I
            enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.

          <h1>Tech Stacks I Work With</h1>
          <p>
            From Flutter and React to Node.js and Firebase, I work with a wide
            range of tools and technologies. My stack includes JavaScript, Dart,
            Python, and various APIs â€” enabling me to develop dynamic apps that
            are both scalable and efficient.

          <h1>Adaptable & Easy to Work With</h1>
          <p>
            I value clear communication and collaboration. No matter the time
            zone or location, I make it a priority to stay in sync with my team
            and clients. I believe great products come from great teamwork â€” and
            Iâ€™m always up for it!

          <h1>What Drives Me</h1>
          <p>
            Coding, for me, is more than just solving problems â€” itâ€™s about
            constant growth and creativity. Whether Iâ€™m building a game, a
            productivity tool, or an AI chatbot, Iâ€™m always curious to explore
            new technologies and deliver something meaningful.
